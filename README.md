Welcome to Image Editor. To run my program, activate my virtual environemnt "cv"

and functions represented in my program:

- manipulate pixels (creating a colored border around an image)

Chapter 05:
- drawing shapes (drawing a rectangle)

Chapter 06:
- image transformations (flipping/reflecting horizontally)
- masking (creating masks for two images when overlaying them on top of each other)
- bitwise operations (combining two masked images to create the overlayed/combined image)
- convert to grayscale (used when masking and detecting canny edges)

Chapter 08:
- Gaussian blur (used to blur image to detect canny edges)

Chapter 09:
- simple thresholding (used to a mask while overlaying images, used to black out certain parts of images)

Chapter 10:
- Canny edge detection (finding the edges of objects)

Chapter 11:
- contours (find contours from canny image to count how many objects/edges there are in an image)
